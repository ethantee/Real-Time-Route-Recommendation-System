# Real-Time Route Recommendation System 🚦🌐

## Overview 📖

This project is part of a simulated real-time system (RTS) coursework focused on designing and implementing a route recommendation system using FreeRTOS.

The primary objective is to analyze, design, develop, and evaluate a small-scale, best-route recommendation system that simulates real-time or near real-time route suggestions for motorists in Kuala Lumpur.

The system aims to address common drawbacks of existing applications, such as lack of real-time updates and congestion in recommended routes.

## Key Features 🌟

- **Real-Time Processing**: Handle multiple routing queries concurrently, providing the shortest and most efficient routes in real-time or near real-time.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Continuously collects, processes, and updates various data types like road networks, driving data, and traffic conditions.
- **Efficiency Evaluation**: Assesses the system's performance in terms of execution speed and maximum throughput, focusing on real-time characteristics.

## Tasks ✅

**Simulation Development**: Design and develop a simulated route recommendation system.

The system should:
- Manage routing queries from numerous users concurrently.
- Calculate the best routes based on current traffic data and road network conditions.
- Update traffic data periodically from motorists' driving data.
- Evaluate performance efficiencies, focusing on real-time response and query handling capabilities.

## Technologies and Tools 🛠️

**FreeRTOS**: Utilized for developing the real-time route recommendation system.
